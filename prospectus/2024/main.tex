\subsection{For our Partners}
What sets UQ MARS apart from other societies is our freedom to hold events alongside neighbouring societies and universities therefore our outreach is not only greatly beneficial to our members but also our partners as a partner of MARS is known throughout the academic space across Brisbane.

In 2023 we successfully held over 20 events that ranged from social events to hackathons, in 2024 we hope to extend this with more partnership engagement. Especially within our workshop series which includes the use of many different CAD software as well as simulation software. When it comes to skills we have taught over the year our members gained exposure to the following but not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Audesk Inventor
    \item Altium Designer
    \item Python Open CV
    \item ROS2 Humble
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Micromouse Competition}
The micromouse competition sees competitors design a small robot to solve a maze of which the path is randomised in the fastest time possible.
This compels competitors to utilise the best algorithms and design the fastest robot mice possible. We aim to host this competition on UQ campus and live-stream it through our YouTube channel. We also intend to include alternative challenges to encourage unique designs and add some flavour to a competition first held in the 1970`s.

\subsection*{Regular Talks and Seminars} 
As a means to introduce members to some of the more obscure and interesting applications of mechatronics and robotics, we plan to make our hosted talks and seminars a regular feature.
These events are presented by researchers, students and industry professionals in fields that they have experience / interest in.

\newpage

\subsection*{Workshops}

Workshops have been at the heart of our society's events. They help our members gain skills they otherwise wouldn't for both professional and personal use.
Where possible, we will be recording our workshops and uploading them to our YouTube account for members' future reference. They could include topics such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item PCB Design   
    \item Mechanical CAD Design
    \item Microcontroller Utilisation
    \item Computer Vision
    \item Path Planning Algorithms
    \item Control System Simulation
\end{itemize}

    \includegraphics[width=0.42\linewidth]{./Photos/Hackathon.jpg}
\end{figure}


\newpage

\subsection*{Microcontroller Hackathon}
Each year, we host a Hackathon in conjunction with Robogals and QUT Robotics.
The event starts with an introduction night, which allowed students the opportunity to network and form teams.
The event pushes for students to connect and form lasting relationships with students from other universities, and develop new skills around embedded technology through project-based learning with Arduinos (such as programming control systems in C++).
Each society will bring one sponsor to judge each team`s project. Each year there is a theme for students to use as a guide.

\subsection*{School Outreach}
We hope to inspire the engineers of tomorrow through outreach workshops intended to introduce current high school students to the fields of mechatronics and robotics.
We will involve members within the running of these workshops to help them with the development of their own interpersonal skills.

\subsection*{Inter-Society and Inter-University Events}
We understand that tertiary study is about far more than just your classes, it's also the connections and friendships you make while undertaking study.
Next year, we are committed to building even stronger relationships with other student societies both at the University of Queensland and beyond.

\newpage

\subsection*{Mechatronics Study Guide}
We are currently developing a comprehensive course guide to aid students in the selection of their courses.
The guide will present suggested program structures, enrolment plans, course profiles, and offer the chance to inform students of the specific pathways available within Mechatronics and adjacent specialisations such as Electrical/Computer Engineering.
We will aim to give specialised advice from our executive team and various UQ MARS Alumni regarding study advice, course selection and general career advice.

\subsection*{Projects \& Competitions}
The most valuable skill that any engineer can gain is the ability to design elegant solutions to problems in the real world, that is why in 2024 with the help of our partners there is a plethora of competitions internationally and globally that UQ MARS has expressions of interest to compete in for many robotics based challenges. Alongside this is a list of in house projects that our executive team has worked tirelessly to manage and with support in 2024 these can be achieved in both the short term and long term and adds a level of engagement to our society that we believe will greatly benefit not only our members but our partners.
